# CloudDevopsEngineerAWS
Cloud DevOps Engineer with AWS - NanoDegree Course By Udacity

Four months Learning path to design and deploy infrastructure as code, build and monitor CI/CD pipelines for different deployment strategies, and deploy scalable microservices using Kubernetes. At the end of the program, we combine the new skills by completing a capstone project.

### 1.0 Deploy Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

In this course, I learned to deploy the underlying infrastructure components that provide security and services to our servers by writing scripts using CloudFormation, AWS’ tool for Infrastructure as Code. I used CloudFormation to deploy Infrastructure patterns that are used in the industry broadly and can be readily used to deploy any cloud application. Like in the real world, I began with initial business requirements that turned into Cloud Architecture Diagrams. Then I deploy this architecture using CloudFormation. 

### 2.0 Build CI/CD Pipelines, Monitoring & Logging

Learning how to stretch for Continuous Delivery as “true north” while I build CI/CD systems that automate the “stuff” between developers and the cloud. I gained essential knowledge and put it into practice as learned about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. I combine my existing knowledge of Cloud Formation and AWS with new tools like Ansible and Circle CI. Also, I learned how to keep an eye on my deployments with proactive monitoring and alerting.

### 3.0 Microservices at Scale using Kubernetes

In this course, created and deployed a kubernetes cluster, configure kubernetes autoscale and load test a kubernetes application. I learned to operationalize both existing and new microservices and apply containers best practices. Also, I deployed Machine Learning microservices that are elastic and fault tolerant. Moreover, learned to pick the appropriate abstraction for microservices: Serverless (AWS Lambda) or Container Orchestration (Kubernetes).
